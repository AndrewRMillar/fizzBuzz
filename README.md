# FizzBuzz

I came across the fizzbuzz problem which appartently is an interview question. The functional code took about 10 minutes, putting it in a function an other 5, refactoring into a few functions another 10, making a page to display the results 10 more, organising it all into a gulp project with a live reload watch function and puting it in a repo an other 30. 
Making it look pretty; can't be arsed.
